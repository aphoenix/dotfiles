Bash Profiles
=============

Source each of these in ~/.bash_profile:

source ~/dotfiles/bash-aliases.sh
source ~/dotfiles/git-completion.sh
source ~/dotfiles/bash-prompt.sh
source ~/dotfiles/bash-colour.sh
source ~/dotfiles/bash-macports.sh


VIM Profile
===========

Nothing special to see here. I keep my vim pretty simple right now.
