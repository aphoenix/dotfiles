Bash Profile
============

The bash profile is simple. There are a lot of helpers for personal projects
and a file to have a pretty spectacular prompt, which I mostly ~~stole~~ borrowed
from Chris Charles.

VIM Profile
===========

Nothing special to see here. I keep my vim pretty simple right now.
